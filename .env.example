# ========== How secrets connect ==========
# • Frontend: reads VITE_* from .env on the machine that runs "npm run dev" or "npm run build".
#   No access to Supabase Secrets; use .env (and in production, your host's build env).
# • Edge functions on Supabase: read SUPABASE_*, RESEND_*, etc. from Supabase Secrets
#   (Dashboard → Project Settings → Edge Functions → Secrets). SUPABASE_URL and keys
#   are often injected automatically; add RESEND_API_KEY etc. there if you use them.
# • Same server code on Make (or other host): set SUPABASE_*, RESEND_*, etc. in that
#   host's environment / secrets, not in Supabase Dashboard.
